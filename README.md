# Rubricjs demo
This is an absolutely barebones 🍖 example implementation of [Rubricjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rubricjs). It is intended to be a code example with minimal functionality. This should demonstrate how to set up an update function, create an entity, handle inputs, and manage a few systems.

Take a look through the code and see what you think.

To run:
```bash
$ npm start
```

To webpack 📦:
```bash
$ npm run watch
```

It is my intention that this demo grow out of my personal codebase of examples as time allows. 🕐
